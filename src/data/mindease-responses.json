  },
  {
    "user_input": "I don't feel good enough",

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I'm scared of the future",

  },
  {

  },
  {

    "user_input": "I'm having nightmares",
    "bot_response": "Nightmares can disrupt your sleep and affect your daily life. Try establishing a calming bedtime routine, avoiding scary content before bed, and practicing relaxation techniques.

If nightmares persist or relate to trauma, a therapist can help."
  },
  {
    "user_input": "I can't forgive myself",
    "bot_response": "Self-forgiveness is often harder than forgiving others, but it's essential for healing. Try treating yourself with the same compassion you'd show a good friend. Acknowledge your mistake, learn from it, and take steps to make amends if needed. Avoid endless self-punishment or believing you don't deserve forgiveness. Everyone makes mistakes - your worth isn't defined by your worst moments."
  },
  {
    "user_input": "I'm jealous of everyone",
    "bot_response": "Jealousy can consume your thoughts and affect relationships.

  },
  {

Most people are more understanding than you think."
  },
  {
    "user_input": "I can't stop crying",
    "bot_response": "Crying is your body's natural way of releasing emotional pain, and it's okay to let it out.

Avoid obsessing over things you can't control and don't let fear prevent you from living. If this fear is overwhelming, a therapist can help you work through it."
  },
  {
    "user_input": "I feel like I'm wasting my life",

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I feel invisible",
    "bot_response": "Feeling invisible can be incredibly isolating and painful.

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I'm having body image issues",
    "bot_response": "Body image struggles affect many people and can be deeply painful. Try practicing body neutrality by focusing on what your body does rather than how it looks.

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I feel like I'm behind in life",
    "bot_response": "Feeling behind is common in our comparison-heavy culture, but everyone's path is unique. Try focusing on your own progress and celebrating your achievements, no matter how small.

You're exactly where you need to be."
  },
  {
    "user_input": "I'm struggling with perfectionism",
    "bot_response": "Perfectionism can be paralyzing and prevent you from enjoying your accomplishments.

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I feel like I can't do anything right",

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I'm having trouble making decisions",
    "bot_response": "Decision-making can feel overwhelming when you're struggling with mental health.

  },
  {
    "user_input": "I feel like I burden everyone",

Sometimes action is better than more thinking."

Try gentle activities to reconnect with emotions, like listening to music, spending time in nature, or creative expression. Be patient with yourself as feelings return. Avoid forcing emotions or judging yourself for feeling numb. This is often temporary and can improve with support and time."

    "user_input": "I'm afraid of getting close to people",
    "bot_response": "Fear of intimacy often develops as protection from being hurt, but it can also prevent meaningful connections. Try taking small steps toward vulnerability with safe people, examining what you're really afraid of, and remembering that not everyone will hurt you. Practice self-compassion about your fears. Avoid letting past hurts prevent all future connections or assuming everyone will leave. Healthy relationships are worth the risk."

    "user_input": "I feel like I'm falling apart",
    "bot_response": "Feeling like you're falling apart is frightening, but sometimes we need to come undone before we can rebuild stronger. Try focusing on one small thing at a time, reaching out for support, and being extra gentle with yourself during this difficult period. Remember that falling apart doesn't mean you're broken forever. Avoid trying to hold everything together perfectly or facing this alone. Sometimes falling apart is the beginning of putting yourself back together in a healthier way."

    "user_input": "I don't know what's wrong with me",
    "bot_response": "Not understanding what you're experiencing can be confusing and scary. Try keeping a journal of your symptoms and feelings, talking to trusted friends about your experiences, and considering professional help to get clarity. Remember that struggling doesn't mean something is fundamentally wrong with you. Avoid diagnosing yourself or believing you're broken. Many mental health challenges are common and treatable - getting clarity is the first step toward feeling better."

  {
    "user_input": "I feel like I'm too sensitive",
    "bot_response": "Being sensitive isn't a flaw - it often means you feel deeply and empathize strongly with others. Try honoring your sensitivity as a strength while learning healthy boundaries. Practice self-care after emotionally intense situations. Surround yourself with people who appreciate your depth of feeling. Avoid apologizing for your emotions or trying to numb your sensitivity. The world needs people who feel deeply and care strongly."

  {
    "user_input": "I'm having trouble letting go",
    "bot_response": "Letting go is often difficult because it involves accepting loss or change, which can feel scary. Try practicing acceptance of what you cannot control, focusing on what you can influence moving forward, and being patient with your process. Letting go is often gradual, not a one-time event. Avoid rushing yourself or feeling bad about taking time to release something important. Healing and acceptance happen at their own pace."

  {
    "user_input": "I feel stuck in life",
    "bot_response": "Feeling stuck is frustrating and can make you feel hopeless, but it's often a sign that change is needed. Try identifying one small step you could take toward change, exploring what's keeping you stuck, and considering what you truly want in life. Sometimes being stuck is preparation for a big leap forward. Avoid overwhelming yourself with massive changes or believing you'll never move forward. Small steps can lead to big transformations."
  },
  {
    "user_input": "I'm worried I'm going crazy",
    "bot_response": "Worrying about your mental state when you're struggling is completely normal and actually shows you're still grounded in reality. Try talking to a mental health professional about your concerns, practicing grounding techniques when anxiety peaks, and remembering that having mental health challenges doesn't mean you're 'crazy.' Avoid catastrophic thinking or self-diagnosing. Many people have these fears when struggling - seeking help shows wisdom, not weakness."

  {
    "user_input": "I don't see the point in anything",
    "bot_response": "Losing your sense of purpose is deeply painful and often a sign of depression. Try engaging in small meaningful activities, connecting with others who share your values, and exploring what used to bring you purpose. Remember that meaning can be found in simple acts of kindness and connection. Avoid making major life decisions while feeling this way and don't dismiss the importance of getting professional help. Purpose and meaning can be restored."
